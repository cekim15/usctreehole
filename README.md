This is our README for Team 33's implementation of USC Tree Hole.

To run this app, we recommend using a Pixel 2 API 24 Nougat emulator in Android Studio.

If it is your first time running the app, it should take you to the login screen. Using the navigation bar on the left, you can navigate to signup and register for an account.

Once logged in, the navigation bar will change to display Home, Profile, and Logout (instead of Login and Signup). The Home tab, which displays posts, also has three tabs: Life, Academic, and Event, which are three different categories of posts. Using the '+' button in the bottom right hand corner, you can write posts. Under each post, there should be a link to view and write replies to that post.

The profile tab will show the name, USC ID, profile picture, and role that you registered with. In this tab, you can edit your profile information as well as change your subscription settings.

From the Home tab, by clicking the bell in the upper right hand corner, you can see notifications for categories you have subscribed to.

FOR 2.5:

Improvements since 2.4:
- There are now notifications for replies.
- Notifications can display on pages that are not just the main post page
- Notifications will display from most recent - oldest regardless of which category they are in.
